Hi! I'm Denis Udovenko, fullstack developer basically specializing on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)/[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) integrations.

I've participated in many **Rails** projects built with together with **React** forntend
and I'm still involved in development based on mentioned tech stack. This kind of job gave
me some experience that might be useful for other developers, that's why I decided to
create this site.

I'm not planning to retell docs and other articles here unless it is required to clarify
something related to the main topic of the post. Instead my goal is to focus on some special
cases I've faced during solving development issues and consulting some clients.

I also have another tech blog meant to help handicap persons with hand prostheses (since
I'm one of those persons and can share some valuable experience in this unusual area) that
at the same time is my playground for trying new approaches and libs. You can find it at
[bionicworkshop.ru](https://bionicworkshop.ru) (for now it is in Russian only). Unlike
the current site, the **Bionicworkshop** is completely custom Single Page Application (**SPA**)
created manually form scratch.
