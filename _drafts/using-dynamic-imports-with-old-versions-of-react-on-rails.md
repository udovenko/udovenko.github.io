> At the moment of writing this post, [React on Rails gem](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) has an integration with [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) and should work fine with [Webpack dynamic imports](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports) so if you are able to swith to the lates version of **React on Rails** - just go ahead, follow gem's official docs and skip this article.

### The history

But if you're still here and reading this, let's return few years back, to the moment when **React on Rails** was using [Rails Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) to fingerprint bundles generated by **Webpack** by including them to regular **Sprockets's** *application.js* and *application.css* files.

Here's how it was actually working:
1. **Webpack** was building **JS** and **CSS** the bundles to *app/assets/webpack* directory. Bundle files should have been named without any hashing by **Webpack**, like *client-bundle.js* and so on.
2. Those bundles were referenced in *app/assets/javascripts/application.js* by direcrtives like `//= require client-bundle` (and something like `@import 'client-bundle';` in *app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss*).
3. In **staging** environments these files were loading to the page by referencing them according to real names. **Asset Pipeline** was simply generating tags like `<script src="assets/client-bundle.js"></script>` and similar for **CCS**.
4. In **production** environments all scripts included in *app/assets/javascripts/application.js* were combined in in single file, compressed by **Uglifier** (or whatever else was set as a **JS** compiler), hashed according that file's **MD5** sum. As a result in production we were getting something like `<script src="/assets/application-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.js"></script>`. Something very similar was happening with **CSS** bundles, created by **Webpack**.

At point **3** and **4** I'm tending to repeat **Asset Pipeline** docs, which I generally don't like to do. So if you need some details about how all these works - just check official docs and [Sprockets](https://github.com/rails/sprockets) repo. There is also a pretty ggod explanation of what I'm trying to describe in old [README form React on Rails repo](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/tree/6.10.0#how-it-works).
